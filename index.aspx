  	<p>The Mono Developers Meeting is a place for users and
  	developers of the open
	source <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono project</a>
	to get together.  We
  	plan on having informative sessions on the project status from
  	different maintainers in the project and also on projects
  	related to Mono.

	<p><b>Important:</b> We are trying to determine how many
	people would be able to attend the meeting so we can book a
	venue that would properly accomodate the audience.

	<p>To help us plan this event, please list your name in
	the <a href="registration.aspx">registration</a> page.

	<p>The event will be held on the 23rd and 24th of October.

	<p>If contributors can stay longer, we will try to find space
	at the Novell offices for joint development sessions after the
	24th.

	<p><b>Sessions start at 9am</b>
