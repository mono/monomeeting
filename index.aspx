  	<p>The Mono Developers Meeting is a place for users and
  	developes of the open
	source <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono project</a>
	to get together.  We
  	plan on having informative sessions on the project status from
  	different maintainers in the project and also on projects
  	related to Mono.

	<p>We are trying to determine how many people would be able to
	attend the meeting so we can book a venue that would properly
	accomodate the audience.

	the <a href="registration.aspx">registration</a> page.

	<p>The event will be held on the the week of the 23rd of

	three days.   Once we have more information we will post
	updates on the actual venue and dates.
